			<h2>PPC - Achieve More Efficient Pay-Per Click(PPC) Marketing</h2>
			<p>PPC (pay-per click) search marketing software offers a means for accomplishing two core requirements for PPC optimization:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PPC Automation - While it would be impossible (and inadvisable!) to automate every aspect of pay-per-click advertising, automating away redundant, time-consuming tasks affords you a means of increasing productivity. Often, this means being able ot produce an amount of work that would otherwise have been unachievable for you and your business.</li>
				<li>PPC Management - PPC management refers to the maintenance and prioritization of paid search marketing tasks. Being able to oversee various aspects of your account while assigning each item on a seemingly endless to-do list an appropriate value can make or break an online ad campaign.</li>
